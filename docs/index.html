<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
<section class="hero">
  <h1>Algo Strategies</h1>
  <div class="pill">Strategies Under Governance · Synthetic-First Laboratories</div>

  <p>
    <strong>Algo Strategies</strong> is a governance-first pillar for implementing, stress-testing, and
    explaining canonical strategy archetypes in a controlled, synthetic environment. It is deliberately
    explicit about what it is <em>not</em>: it does not promise alpha discovery, market prediction,
    or a shortcut to deployable production systems. Its purpose is more demanding and more useful:
    <strong>mechanism clarity under constraint</strong>. If you cannot explain why a policy behaves the way it
    behaves when the market state changes, then performance is just a story you tell yourself while the
    risk accumulates off-screen.
  </p>

  <p>
    The decision to use synthetic markets is not an aesthetic choice. It is a governance choice.
    Real data seduces practitioners into narrative reasoning: “it worked before, so it works.”
    Synthetic construction forces a different posture: you must state your assumptions, encode them,
    and accept that the environment will expose the strategy’s dependencies. In this pillar,
    regimes are not hand-waved; they are parameterized. Liquidity is not a footnote; it is a binding
    constraint. Costs are not a line item; they are a surface that reshapes the feasible action space.
    The goal is not to mimic history. The goal is to isolate the structural channels—trend persistence,
    mean reversion, carry, factor dispersion, correlation compression, execution convexity—and watch
    how they interact with the policy you claim to understand.
  </p>

  <p>
    Most “strategy education” fails in predictable ways. It confuses narrative with mechanism, treats
    costs as rounding error, and turns backtests into mythology. A backtest can be a useful diagnostic,
    but it is not evidence of understanding. It is a single sample path under a particular cost model,
    a particular rebalance cadence, and a particular regime sequence. This pillar refuses that bargain.
    Every notebook implements a full governed pipeline:
    <strong>synthetic market construction → signal isolation → portfolio rules → costs/slippage → stress tests → stage gates → artifact logging</strong>.
    The point is not to optimize. The point is to remove hiding places. If a strategy only looks “good”
    when you ignore turnover, dilute impact, assume perfect fills, or pretend regimes don’t break,
    the laboratory is designed to make that obvious quickly and reproducibly.
  </p>

  <p>
    The core idea is simple: strategies are policies operating inside constrained control systems.
    A signal may be clever, but realized outcomes are shaped by feasibility and control: execution,
    turnover limits, liquidity floors, leverage caps, volatility targeting, drawdown stops, and
    the geometry of correlation under stress. These are not implementation details; they are the
    real strategy. Governance is therefore not decoration; it is the condition for honest research.
    Each run produces a disciplined audit trail—manifests, risk logs, and deliverables—explicitly
    marked <strong>Not verified</strong> until independently reviewed. That posture is the entire point:
    a professional system is not defined by how confidently it speaks, but by how well it can be
    reconstructed, challenged, and supervised.
  </p>

  <div class="callout">
    <strong>Explicit positioning:</strong> This pillar teaches strategy archetypes as governed mechanisms.
    It is not an alpha-seeking program. Reproducibility and auditability dominate optimization.

  <h2>The Book </h2>

  <p>
    The book is the conceptual spine of the pillar. The notebooks are not substitutes for the book,
    and the book is not complete without execution. Together they form a single, governed apprenticeship unit:
    mechanism → implementation → stress → gate decision → artifacts.

      <h3>Book — Strategy for Traders</h3>
      <p>
        A governance-first framing of strategy archetypes: how to implement mechanisms in synthetic markets,
        isolate signals, impose portfolio constraints, model costs, stress the system, and produce auditable deliverables.
        The emphasis is structural honesty rather than performance storytelling.

  <h2>The Ten Strategy Notebooks (Governed Colab Laboratories)</h2>

  <p>
    Each notebook implements the same disciplined pipeline and produces run artifacts
    (manifest, prompts log, risk log, deliverables) to support reproducibility and review.
    The ten notebooks represent canonical strategy archetypes, framed as mechanisms rather than “ideas.”

<!-- EVALUATION -->
<section>
  <h2>Independent Assessment (GPT 5.2) </h2>

  <div class="reviewbox">
    <div class="stars">⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</div>

    <p>
      This pillar is unusually strict about research hygiene. By forcing synthetic construction,
      cost modeling, stress suites, and stage-gate decisions, it prevents the most common failure mode in retail strategy education:
      confusing a backtest narrative for a mechanism. The result is less hype, more engineering.
    </p>

    <p>
      The strongest contribution is governance integration. The “deliverables per run” structure makes it
      straightforward to replicate, audit, and critique. This shifts the learner’s posture from “optimize returns”
      to “explain behavior under constraint,” which is closer to how professional research should operate.
