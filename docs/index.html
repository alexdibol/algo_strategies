<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
<section class="hero">
  <h1>Algo Strategies</h1>
  <div class="pill">Strategies Under Governance · Synthetic-First Laboratories</div>

  <p>
    <strong>Algo Strategies</strong> is a governance-first pillar for implementing, stress-testing, and explaining
    canonical strategy archetypes in a controlled, synthetic environment. It is deliberately explicit about what it is
    <em>not</em>: it does not promise alpha discovery, market prediction, or a shortcut to deployable production systems.
    Its purpose is more demanding and more useful: <strong>mechanism clarity under constraint</strong>.
    If you cannot explain why a policy behaves the way it behaves when the state changes, then “performance” is just
    a story you tell yourself while risk accumulates off-screen.
  </p>

  <p>
    The choice to use synthetic markets is not an aesthetic preference. It is a governance decision.
    Real data seduces practitioners into narrative reasoning: “it worked before, so it works.”
    Synthetic construction forces a different posture: you must state your assumptions, encode them,
    and accept that the environment will reveal the dependencies you would otherwise ignore.
    Regimes are parameterized. Liquidity is a binding constraint. Correlation structure is explicit.
    Costs are modeled as a surface that reshapes the action space. The goal is not to mimic history.
    The goal is to isolate channels—trend persistence, mean reversion, carry, dispersion, correlation compression,
    execution convexity—and observe how those channels interact with the policy you claim to understand.
  </p>

  <p>
    Most “strategy education” fails in predictable ways. It confuses narrative with mechanism, treats costs as a footnote,
    and turns backtests into mythology. A backtest can be a diagnostic, but it is not evidence of understanding.
    It is a single sample path under a particular cost model, a particular rebalance cadence, and a particular regime sequence.
    This pillar refuses that bargain. Every notebook implements a full governed pipeline:
    <strong>synthetic market construction → signal isolation → portfolio rules → costs/slippage → stress tests → stage gates → artifact logging</strong>.
    If a strategy survives only when you assume perfect fills, ignore turnover, dilute impact, or pretend regimes do not break,
    the laboratory is designed to make that obvious quickly, deterministically, and with a reviewable audit trail.
  </p>

  <p>
    The core idea is simple: strategies are policies operating inside constrained control systems.
    A signal may be clever, but realized outcomes are shaped by feasibility and control—execution, turnover limits,
    liquidity floors, leverage caps, volatility targeting, drawdown stops, and the geometry of correlation under stress.
    These are not implementation details; they are the real strategy. Governance is therefore not decoration; it is the condition
    for honest research. Each run produces a disciplined audit trail—manifests, risk logs, and deliverables—explicitly marked
    <strong>Not verified</strong> until independently replicated and reviewed. That posture is the point: a professional system
    is defined by how well it can be reconstructed, challenged, and supervised.
  </p>

  <div class="callout">
    <strong>Explicit positioning:</strong> This pillar teaches strategy archetypes as governed mechanisms.
    It is not an alpha-seeking program. Reproducibility and auditability dominate optimization.

  <h2>The Book</h2>

  <p>
    The book is not optional context; it is the interpretive layer that keeps this pillar honest.
    The notebooks are not substitutes for the book, and the book is not complete without execution.
    Together they form a single apprenticeship unit: mechanism → implementation → stress → gate decision → artifacts.
    The objective is to cultivate a professional habit: do not argue from a chart—argue from a reproducible experiment
    with explicit assumptions and documented failure modes.

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Book — Strategy for Traders</h3>
      <p>
        A governance-first framework for thinking about strategy archetypes as constrained control problems.
        It explains the pipeline each notebook implements: synthetic market design, signal isolation, portfolio mapping,
        execution and slippage realism, stress methodology, and stage-gate discipline. The emphasis is structural honesty:
        when a mechanism fails, the goal is to learn precisely <em>why</em> it failed and what constraint actually bound.

  <h2>The Ten Strategy Notebooks (Governed Colab Laboratories)</h2>

  <p>
    Each notebook is intentionally complete: it constructs a synthetic market with regime structure,
    isolates a signal channel, maps that signal into a portfolio policy, pays costs, runs stress attacks,
    and produces a stage-gate decision plus an artifact bundle that makes the run reproducible and reviewable.
    This is the opposite of “strategy as lore.” It is strategy as an auditable mechanism you can challenge.
  </p>

  <div class="grid">

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Chapter 1 — CAPM Alpha Ranking</h3>
      <p>
        Residual-based cross-sectional selection framed as an estimation-and-turnover problem. The notebook highlights
        how dispersion and covariance geometry determine whether ranking is meaningful, and how small beta misestimation
        under volatility expansion can collapse apparent “alpha” into noise and churn.

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Chapter 2 — Fundamental Factor Long–Short</h3>
      <p>
        Factor sorting implemented as a governed long–short policy with explicit neutrality, leverage, and friction proxies.
        The focus is not on ideology (“value works”) but on feasibility: when factor dispersion shrinks, correlations compress,
        or costs rise, the policy’s theoretical edge can be dominated by implementation debt.

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Chapter 3 — Style Rotation</h3>
      <p>
        Style rotation treated as a policy over regime-conditioned return surfaces rather than a story about cycles.
        The notebook emphasizes persistence and transition risk: style leadership can flip faster than execution can rotate,
        turning “rotation” into a cost-amplified chase without stable exposure.

    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Chapter 4 — Momentum + Market Risk Gate</h3>
      <p>
        Momentum framed as conditional participation. The strategy is defined by the interaction of a ranking signal with a
        market-risk gate that controls exposure when volatility, correlation, or crash regimes make continuation bets fragile.
        The mechanism lesson: the gate often matters more than the momentum formula.

      <h3>Chapter 5 — Turn-of-the-Month Seasonality</h3>
      <p>
        Calendar seasonality treated as a concentrated execution problem rather than a free statistical anomaly.
        The notebook explores how narrow windows amplify turnover and crowding, and how cost surfaces can erase small edges,
        forcing a realistic trade-off between participation and implementation feasibility.

    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Chapter 6 — Short-Term Reversal</h3>
      <p>
        Mean-reversion implemented with explicit horizon alignment and stress-aware costs. The notebook attacks the classic
        fragility: correlation compression and liquidity stress synchronize names and inflate impact, turning “reversal”
        into churn unless the policy respects execution capacity and regime shifts.

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Chapter 7 — Momentum–Reversal Hybrid</h3>
      <p>
        A blended policy that exposes a common misunderstanding: combining signals does not automatically diversify risk.
        The notebook shows when hybridization stabilizes exposure by regime-conditioning, and when it simply stacks turnover,
        cost sensitivity, and contradictory timing into a fragile, overactive control loop.

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Chapter 8 — Pairs Trading</h3>
      <p>
        Relative-value mean-reversion with explicit spread dynamics and break risk. The notebook emphasizes the true failure mode:
        the spread stops being stationary precisely when you need it most. Correlation breaks, liquidity asymmetry, and execution debt
        can dominate “convergence,” making governance and stress attacks essential to honest interpretation.

    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Chapter 9 — Dynamic Breakout</h3>
      <p>
        Breakout policies treated as boundary-sensitive control systems. The notebook explores the responsiveness–churn surface:
        shorter lookbacks increase signal frequency and turnover, longer lookbacks reduce churn but miss transitions. Costs and liquidity
        convert that trade-off into a feasibility constraint, not a stylistic preference.

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Chapter 10 — Futures Trend + Carry</h3>
      <p>
        Trend and carry are modeled as distinct economic channels and then combined under leverage caps and volatility targeting.
        The notebook emphasizes surfaces: the feasibility surface shaped by risk limits and the execution surface shaped by turnover
        and convex impact. The mechanism lesson: “blend” is not diversification unless constraints remain stable under regime stress.

<!-- EVALUATION -->
<section>
  <h2>Independent Assessment (GPT-5.2)</h2>

  <div class="reviewbox">
    <div class="stars">⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</div>

    <p>
      This pillar is unusually strict about research hygiene. By forcing synthetic construction, cost modeling,
      stress suites, and stage-gate decisions, it prevents the most common failure mode in strategy education:
      confusing a coherent narrative for a mechanism. The result is less hype, more engineering—and an explicit refusal
      to claim “edge” without a reproducible experimental chain.
    </p>

    <p>
      The strongest contribution is governance integration. The run-level deliverables make it straightforward to
      replicate, audit, and critique behavior. This shifts the learner’s posture from “optimize returns” to
      “explain outcomes under constraint,” which is closer to professional research practice and model-risk discipline.
